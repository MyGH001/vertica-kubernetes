First off, thank you for considering contributing to *vertica-kubernetes* and helping make it even better than it is today!

This document will guide you through the contribution process. There are a number of ways you can help:

 - [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)
 - [Code Contributions](#code-contributions)
 
# Bug Reports

If you find a bug, submit an [issue](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues) with a complete and reproducible bug report. If the issue can't be reproduced, it will be closed. If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own, comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue.

For issues (e.g. security related issues) that are **not suitable** to be reported publicly on the GitHub issue system, report your issues to [Vertica open source team](mailto:vertica-opensrc@microfocus.com) directly or file a case with Vertica support if you have a support account.

# Feature Requests

Feel free to share your ideas for how to improve *vertica-kubernetes*. Weâ€™re always open to suggestions.
You can open an [issue](https://github.com/vertica/vertica-kubernetes/issues)
with details describing what feature(s) you'd like added or changed.

# Code Contributions

At this time we are not accepting any code contributions.  We are in the process of converting the helm chart to the [operator framework](https://operatorframework.io/).  When that is done, we will commit the operator to this repository and open it up for outside contributions.
